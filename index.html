       <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="text-center display-4">Project Overview</h1>
        <p class="lead">Girls on the Run is a national organization with a goal of encouraging young girls, building their confidence and providing positive influence into their lives. They primarily do this through exercise and running. 

            Parents of young girls wanting to get their daughter(s) involved in the organization, as well as those interested in volunteering, have a handful of unanswered questions after visiting the website. This could lead users to become disinterested in GOTR and look for other organizations to support.
            
            Our team redesigned the Girls on the Run website for desktop and mobile to make it cleaner and more user friendly for both volunteers and parents wanting to sign their daughters up to participate.

      <!--User Research-->
      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="text-center display-4">User Research</h1>
        <p class="text-center lead">The team started by preparing a user research plan and conducting 3 volunteer interviews and 3 parent interviews.</p>

      <div class="jumbotron">
        <p class="text-center lead">After our user interviews we had a clear picture of who our User Persona was: Susan is a 38 year old mom who not only wants to sign her daughter up to participate but she also wants to volunteer. She wants an organization she can trust, and she wants to easily find the information she’s looking for without doing a lot of searching.</p>

      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="text-center display-4">Definition & Ideation</h1>
        <p class="text-center lead">To better understand the potential improvements we could make, we did some research on competitors such as Boys and Girls Club, UNICEF, and an after-school program at a local elementary school. We then conducted a SWOT analysis to find the opportunities for Girls on the Run.</p>

      <!--Prototyping-->
      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="text-center display-4">Prototyping</h1>
        <p class="text-center lead">Based on our user flow, we created LO-FI wireframes for the homepage, volunteer page, and parent’s page. We made some changes based on our research. For example, we made sure the donation button was prominent and users could find it on any page of the website. We cut down the amount of unnecessary info on each page to keep it clean and clear. We also created a new page that’s for parents. We learned from our interviews that parents would like more information before they put their kids in this program. It is hard to find this information on the original website. 
            On the new parent’s page we created we made sure parents have all of the information they need such as learning more about the program, signing their children up, safety concerns addressed and activity information.</p>

      <!--Usability Testing-->
      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="text-center display-4">Usability Testing</h1>
        <p class="text-center lead">We performed a handful of user tests using our low fidelity wireflows, and had each of them complete 3 tasks: Donate $50 Monthly, Sign Up to Support a 5K, and Learn more about the 6th-8th Grade Program.</p>

      <!--Final Design-->
      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h1 class="text-center display-4">Final Design</h1>
        <p class="text-center lead">We learned that the website was not delivering the information users were seeking, and we addressed these concerns by completing a redesign of the website.  

            After completing the newly designed website, the main concerns of our users were addressed. But, with those issues out of the way, other problems revealed themselves, such as a few navigation issues. We found this very interesting because these things would have always been an issue on the original website as well, but the other concerns of the users overshadowed these somewhat smaller issues that we found after completing the redesign. 
            
            Our next steps from here would be that we want to make a few more tweaks to the navigation and where users might find certain links or information. We also want to continue to build out more pages of the website, starting with the “our impact” page, and the “about us” page.  Finally we want to work on sign up forms, such as signing up to volunteer, or signing up your child for Girls on the Run. 
            
            After completing this project and really diving into this organization, all of us grew somewhat of an attachment or connection to GOTR now, and who knows maybe we will even support a 5K with them one day. </p>
